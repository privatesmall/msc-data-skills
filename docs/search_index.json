["acknowledgements.html", "Acknowledgements 10.5 Contributors", " Acknowledgements The whole psyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology deserves enormous thanks for making it possible and rewarding to teach methods with a focus on reproducibility and open science. Particularly Heather Cleland Woods, Phil McAleer, Helena Paterson, Emily Nordmann, Benedict Jones, and Niamh Stack. We greatly appreciate Iris Holzleitner's volunteer in-class assistance with the first year of this course. We were ever so lucky to get Rebecca Lai as a teaching assistant in the second year; her kind and patient approach to teaching technical skills is an inspiration. Thanks to DaniÃ«l Lakens for many inspirational discussions and resources. 10.5 Contributors Several people contributed to testing these materials. Rebecca Lai Richard Morey Mossa Merhi Reimert "]
