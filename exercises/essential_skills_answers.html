## Loading a Library

Almost every script you write will need to load a library. Do this at the top of the script. In the code chunk below, load the `tidyverse` and `readxl` libraries. You can check if you have a library under the Packages tab in the lower right RStudio pane. You might need to use `install.packages("tidyverse")` to install these libraries on your computer, but **never** put `install.packages()` in a script (just type that command directly into the console window).


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Assigning Variables and Data Types

The main data types you will use are *numeric* (*integer* or *double*), *character*, and *boolean*.

You assign data to variables with the *assignment operator* `<-`. Assign the following variables:

* set the variable `four` to the integer 4
* set the variable `one_plus_3` to the sum of the integer 1 and the integer 3
* set `double_four` to the number four as a *double*
* set the variable `lower` to your first name in all lowercase letters
* set the variable `UPPER` to your first name in all uppercase letters



```r
four <- 4L
one_plus_3 <- 1L + 3L
double_four <- 4
lower <- "lisa"
UPPER <- "LISA"
```

## Comparison

The *comparison* operators, such as `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` let you compare data and/or variables. Remember, `=` *sets* the left side of the equation equal to the right side, while `==` checks if the left and right sides are *equivalent*.

If you assign a variable to the outcome of a comparison, such as `is_equal <- 10 == 5 + 5`, the variable will be TRUE if the comparison is true and FALSE if the comparison is false. Assign the following variables to the outcome of the specified comparison:

* `comp_1_eq_2`: is the integer 1 equal to the integer 2?
* `comp_a_eq_A`: is the character "a" equal to the character "A"?
* `comp_10_lt_20`: is the number 10 less than the number 20?
* `comp_four_gte_one_plus_3` is the variable `four` greater than or equal to the variable `one_plus_3`


```r
comp_1_eq_2 <- 1L == 2L
comp_a_eq_A <- "a" == "A"
comp_10_lt_20 <- 10 < 20
comp_four_gte_one_plus_3 <- four >= one_plus_3
```


## Forming a vector

A vector is a list of 1 or more items of the same data type. Create the following variables:

* `beatles`: a list of first names John, Paul, George, and Ringo
* `one_to_ten`: a list of the integers 1 through 10
* `evens`: a list of the even integers from 2 to 10
* `a_to_e`: the first 5 items in the built-in vector `letters`


```r
beatles <- c("John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo")
one_to_ten <- 1:10
evens <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) # seq(2, 10, by = 2)
a_to_e <- letters[1:5]
```

## Vectorised Operations

* `by_tens`: multiply each item in the vector `one_to_ten` by 10
* `squares`: make a 10-item vector with the square of the numbers 1 to 10 (multiply each number by itself)
* `a_to_e_1`: use the `paste0` function and the `a_to_e` variable you created above to create a vector that looks like `"a1", "b2", "c3", "d4", "e5"`.


```r
by_tens <- one_to_ten * 10
squares <- 1:10 * 1:10 # (1:10)^2
a_to_e_1 <- paste0(a_to_e, 1:5)
```

## Loading Data

You can load data straight from a website using the URL. Use tidyverse functions for reading CSV and Excel files to create the following variables:

* `infmort`: load data in the CSV file "https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/infmort.csv" using the URL
* `matmort`: download the excel file [matmort.xls](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/matmort.xls) into a directory called `data` in the same directory as this file and load the local file using a function from the package `readxl`


```r
infmort <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/infmort.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   Country = col_character(),
##   Year = col_double(),
##   `Infant mortality rate (probability of dying between birth and age 1 per 1000 live births)` = col_character()
## )
```

```r
matmort <- read_xls("data/matmort.xls")
```
