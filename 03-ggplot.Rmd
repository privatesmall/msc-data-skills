## Setup

```{r setup, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# libraries needed for these graphs
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(cowplot) 
set.seed(30250) # makes sure random numbers are reproducible

```

## Common Variable Combinations {#vartypes}

**Continuous** variables are properties you can measure, like height. **Discrete** (or categorical) variables are things you can count, like the number of pets you have. Categorical variables can be **nominal**, where the categories don't really have an order, like cats, dogs and ferrets (even though ferrets are obviously best). They can also be **ordinal**, where there is a clear order, but the distance between the categories isn't something you could exactly equate, like points on a Likert rating scale.

Different types of visualisations are good for different types of variables. 

```{block, type="try"}
Before you read ahead, come up with an example of each type of variable combination and sketch the types of graphs that would best display these data.

* 1 discrete
* 1 continuous
* 2 discrete
* 2 continuous
* 1 discrete, 1 continuous
* 3 continuous

```

### Data

The code below creates some data frames with different types of data. We'll learn how to simulate data like this in the [Probability & Simulation](#sim) chapter, but for now just run the code chunk below.

* `pets` has a column with pet type
* `pet_happy` has `happiness` and `age` for 500 dog owners and 500 cat owners
* `x_vs_y` has two correlated continuous variables (`x` and `y`)
* `overlap` has two correlated ordinal variables and 1000 observations so there is a lot of overlap
* `overplot` has two correlated continuous variables and 10000 observations

```{block, type = "try"}
First, think about what kinds of graphs are best for representing these different types of data.
```

```{r sim-data}

pets <- tibble(
  pet = sample(
    c("dog", "cat", "ferret", "bird", "fish"), 
    100, 
    TRUE, 
    c(0.45, 0.40, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05)
  )
)

pet_happy <- tibble(
  pet = rep(c("dog", "cat"), each = 500),
  happiness = c(rnorm(500, 55, 10), rnorm(500, 45, 10)),
  age = rpois(1000, 3) + 20
)

x_vs_y <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = x + rnorm(100, 0, 0.5)
)

overlap <- tibble(
  x = rbinom(1000, 10, 0.5),
  y = x + rbinom(1000, 20, 0.5)
)

overplot <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = x + rnorm(10000, 0, 0.5)
)

```



## Basic Plots

### Bar plot {#geom_bar}

Bar plots are good for categorical data where you want to represent the count.

```{r barplot, fig.cap="Bar plot"}
ggplot(pets, aes(pet)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### Density plot {#geom_density}

Density plots are good for one continuous variable, but only if you have a fairly 
large number of observations.

```{r density, fig.cap="Density plot"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(happiness)) +
  geom_density()

```

You can represent subsets of a variable by assigning the category variable to the argument `group`, `fill`, or `color`. 

```{r density-grouped, fig.cap="Grouped density plot"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(happiness, fill = pet)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)

```

```{block, type="try"}
Try changing the `alpha` argument to figure out what it does.
```

### Frequency Polygons {#geom_freqpoly}

If you don't want smoothed distributions, try `geom_freqpoly()`.

```{r freqpoly, fig.cap="Frequency ploygon plot"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(happiness, color = pet)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
  
```

``````{block, type="try"}
Try changing the `binwidth` argument to 5 and 0.1. How do you figure out the right value?
```

### Histogram {#geom_histogram}

Histograms are also good for one continuous variable, and work well if you don't have many observations. Set the `binwidth` to control how wide each bar is.

```{r histogram, fig.cap="Histogram"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(happiness)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "white", color = "black")
  
```

```{block, type="info"}
Histograms in ggplot look pretty bad unless you set the `fill` and `color`.
```

If you show grouped histograms, you also probably want to change the default `position` argument.

```{r histogram-grouped, fig.cap="Grouped Histogram"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.5, position = "dodge")
  
```

```{block, type="try"}
Try changing the `position` argument to "identity", "fill", "dodge", or "stack".
```

### Column plot {#geom_col}

Column plots are the worst way to represent grouped continuous data, but also one of the most common.

To make column plots with error bars, you first need to calculate the means, error bar uper limits (`ymax`) and error bar lower limits (`ymin`) for each category. You'll learn more about how to use the code below in the next two lessons.

```{r colplot, fig.cap="Column plot"}

# calculate mean and SD for each pet
avg_pet_happy <- pet_happy %>%
  group_by(pet) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(happiness),
    sd = sd(happiness)
  )

ggplot(avg_pet_happy, aes(pet, mean, fill=pet)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd), width = 0.25) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40)

```

```{block, type="try"}
What do you think `geom_hline()` does?
```

### Boxplot {#geom_boxplot}

Boxplots are great for representing the distribution of grouped continuous 
variables. They fix most of the problems with using barplots for continuous data.

```{r boxplot, fig.cap="Box plot"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)

```

### Violin plot {#geom_violin}

Violin pots are like sideways, mirrored density plots. They give even more information than a boxplot about distribution and are especially useful when you have non-normal distributions.

```{r violin, fig.cap="Violin plot"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), 
    alpha = 0.5
  )

```

```{block, type="try"}
Try changing the numbers in the `draw_quantiles` argument.
```

### Scatter plot {#geom_point}

Scatter plots are a good way to represent the relationship between two continuous variables.

```{r scatter, fig.cap="Scatter plot using geom_point()"}

ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()

```

### Line graph {#geom_smooth}

You often want to represent the relationship as a single line.

```{r line, fig.cap="Line plot using geom_smooth()"}
ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

## Customisation

### Labels {#custom-labels}

You can set custom titles and axis labels in a few different ways.

```{r line-labels1, fig.cap="Set custom labels with ggtitle(), xlab() and ylab()"}
ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  ggtitle("My Plot Title") +
  xlab("The X Variable") +
  ylab("The Y Variable")
```

```{r line-labels2, fig.cap="Set custom labels with labs()"}
ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(title = "My Plot Title",
       x = "The X Variable",
       y = "The Y Variable")
```

### Colours {#custom-colours}

You can set custom values for colour and fill using functions like `scale_colour_manual()` and `scale_fill_manual()`. The [Colours chapter in Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/) has many more ways to customise colour.

```{r line-labels, fig.cap="Set custom colour"}
ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, colour = pet, fill = pet)) +
  geom_violin() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkgreen", "dodgerblue")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#CCFFCC", "#BBDDFF"))
```
 
### Save as File {#ggsave}

You can save a ggplot using `ggsave()`. It saves the last ggplot you made, 
by default, but you can specify which plot you want to save if you assigned that plot to a variable.

You can set the `width` and `height` of your plot. The default units are inches, but you can change the `units` argument to "in", "cm", or "mm".


```{r ggsave-example, eval = FALSE}

box <- ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)

violin <- ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5)

ggsave("demog_violin_plot.png", width = 5, height = 7)

ggsave("demog_box_plot.jpg", plot = box, width = 5, height = 7)

```


## Combination Plots

### Violinbox plot

To demonstrate the use of `facet_grid()` for factorial designs, we create a new column called `agegroup` to split the data into participants older than the meadian age or younger than the median age. New factors will display in alphabetical order, so we can use the `factor()` function to set the levels in the order we want.

```{r violinbox, fig.cap="Violin-box plot"}

pet_happy %>%
  mutate(agegroup = ifelse(age<median(age), "Younger", "Older"),
         agegroup = factor(agegroup, levels = c("Younger", "Older"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
    geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha=0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.25, fill="white") +
    facet_grid(.~agegroup) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("orange", "green"))

```

```{block, type="info"}
Set the `show.legend` argument to `FALSE` to hide the legend. We do this here because the x-axis already labels the pet types.
```

### Violin-point-range plot

You can use `stat_summary()` to superimpose a point-range plot showning the mean ± 1 SD. You'll learn how to write your own functions in the lesson on [Iteration and Functions](#func).

```{r stat-summary, fig.cap="Point-range plot using stat_summary()"}

ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    fun.y = mean,
    fun.ymax = function(x) {mean(x) + sd(x)},
    fun.ymin = function(x) {mean(x) - sd(x)},
    geom="pointrange"
  )

```

### Violin-jitter plot

If you don't have a lot of data points, it's good to represent them individually. You can use `geom_jitter` to do this.

```{r violin-jitter, fig.cap="Violin-jitter plot"}

pet_happy %>%
  sample_n(50) %>%  # choose 50 random observations from the dataset
  ggplot(aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), 
    alpha = 0.5
  ) + 
  geom_jitter(
    width = 0.15, # points spread out over 15% of available width
    height = 0, # do not move position on the y-axis
    alpha = 0.5, 
    size = 3
  )

```

### Scatter-line graph

If your graph isn't too complicated, it's good to also show the individual data points behind the line.

```{r scatter-line, fig.cap="Scatter-line plot"}

ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```

### Grid of plots {#cowplot}

You can use the [ `cowplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html) package to easily make grids of different graphs. First, you have to assign each plot a name. Then you list all the plots as the first arguments of `plot_grid()` and provide a list of labels.

```{r cowplot, message = FALSE, fig.cap="Grid of plots using cowplot"}

my_hist <- ggplot(pet_happy, aes(happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 1, 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    position = "dodge", 
    show.legend = FALSE
  )

my_violin <- ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.5), 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    show.legend = FALSE
  )

my_box <- ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5, show.legend = FALSE)

my_density <- ggplot(pet_happy, aes(happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5, show.legend = FALSE)

my_bar <- pet_happy %>%
  group_by(pet) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(happiness),
    sd = sd(happiness)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pet, mean, fill=pet)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", alpha = 0.5, 
             color = "black", show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd), width = 0.25)

plot_grid(
  my_violin, 
  my_box, 
  my_density, 
  my_bar, 
  labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D")
)

```


## Overlapping Discrete Data {#overlap}

### Reducing Opacity 

You can deal with overlapping data points (very common if you're using Likert scales) by reducing the opacity of the points. You need to use trial and error to adjust these so they look right.

```{r overlap-alpha, fig.cap="Deal with overlapping data using transparency"}

ggplot(overlap, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = .05) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```

### Proportional Dot Plots {#geom_count}

Or you can set the size of the dot proportional to the number of overlapping observations using `geom_count()`.

```{r overlap-size, fig.cap="Deal with overlapping data using geom_count()"}

overlap %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_count(color = "#663399")

```

Alternatively, you can transform your data to create a count column and use the count to set the dot colour.

```{r overlap-colour, fig.cap="Deal with overlapping data using dot colour"}

overlap %>%
  group_by(x, y) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color=count)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  scale_color_viridis_c()

```


```{block, type="info"}
The [viridis package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) changes the colour themes to be easier to read by people with colourblindness and to print better in greyscale. Viridis is built into `ggplot2` since v3.0.0. It uses `scale_colour_viridis_c()` and `scale_fill_viridis_c()` for continuous variables and `scale_colour_viridis_d()` and `scale_fill_viridis_d()` for discrete variables.
```

## Overlapping Continuous Data

Even if the variables are continuous, overplotting might obscure any relationships if you have lots of data.

```{r overplot-point, fig.cap="Overplotted data"}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point()
```

### 2D Density Plot {#geom_density2d}
Use `geom_density2d()` to create a contour map.

```{r density2d, fig.cap="Contour map with geom_density2d()"}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_density2d()
```

You can use `stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon")` to create a heatmap-style density plot. 

```{r density2d-fill, fig.cap="Heatmap-density plot"}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```


### 2D Histogram {#geom_bin2d}

Use `geom_bin2d()` to create a rectangular heatmap of bin counts. Set the `binwidth` to the x and y dimensions to capture in each box.

```{r bin2d, fig.cap="Heatmap of bin counts"}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_bin2d(binwidth = c(1,1))
```

### Hexagonal Heatmap {#geom_hex}

Use `geomhex()` to create a hexagonal heatmap of bin counts. Adjust the `binwidth`, `xlim()`, `ylim()` and/or the figure dimensions to make the hexagons more or less stretched.

```{r overplot-hex, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Hexagonal heatmap of bin counts"}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_hex(binwidth = c(0.25, 0.25))
```

### Correlation Heatmap {#geom_tile}

I've included the code for creating a correlation matrix from a table of variables, but you don't need to understand how this is done yet. We'll cover `mutate()` and `gather()` functions in the [dplyr](#dplyr) and [tidyr](#tidyr) lessons.

```{r}
# generate two sets of correlated variables (a and b)
heatmap <- tibble(
    a1 = rnorm(100),
    b1 = rnorm(100)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    a2 = a1 + rnorm(100),
    a3 = a1 + rnorm(100),
    a4 = a1 + rnorm(100),
    b2 = b1 + rnorm(100),
    b3 = b1 + rnorm(100),
    b4 = b1 + rnorm(100)
  ) %>%
  cor() %>% # create the correlation matrix
  as.data.frame() %>% # make it a data frame
  rownames_to_column(var = "V1") %>% # set rownames as V1
  gather("V2", "r", a1:b4) # wide to long (V2)
```

Once you have a correlation matrix in the correct (long) format, it's easy to make a heatmap using `geom_tile()`.

```{r heatmap, fig.cap="Heatmap using geom_tile()"}
ggplot(heatmap, aes(V1, V2, fill=r)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

```{block, type="info"}
The file type is set from the filename suffix, or by 
specifying the argument `device`, which can take the following values: 
"eps", "ps", "tex", "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf".
```

## Interactive Plots {#plotly}

You can use the `plotly` package to make interactive graphs. Just assign your ggplot to a variable and use the function `ggplotly()`.

```{r plotly, message = FALSE, fig.cap="Interactive graph using plotly"}

demog_plot <- ggplot(pet_happy, aes(pet, happiness, fill=pet)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width= 0.2, height = 0), size = 2)

ggplotly(demog_plot)

```

```{block, type="info"}
Hover over the data points above and click on the legend items.
```

## Quiz {#ggplot-quiz}

1. Generate a plot like this from the built-in dataset `iris`. Make sure to include the custom axis labels.

    ```{r quiz-boxplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = ""}
    ggplot(iris, aes(Species, Petal.Width, fill = Species)) +
      geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
      xlab("Flower Species") +
      ylab("Petal Width (in cm)")
    ```
    
    ```{r quiz-boxplot-answer, eval = FALSE, webex.hide = TRUE}
    ggplot(iris, aes(Species, Petal.Width, fill = Species)) +
      geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
      xlab("Flower Species") +
      ylab("Petal Width (in cm)")
    
    # there are many ways to do things, the code below is also correct
    ggplot(iris) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(Species, Petal.Width, fill = Species), show.legend = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Flower Species",
           y = "Petal Width (in cm)")
    ```


2. You have just created a plot using the following code. How do you save it?
    ```{r quiz-save, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + 
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = lm)
    ```
    
    ```{r quiz-save-answer, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
    cat("<pre class=\"mcq\">")
    c(
      "ggsave()",
      "ggsave(\"figname\")",
      answer = "ggsave(\"figname.png\")",
      "ggsave(\"figname.png\", plot = cars)"
    ) %>%
      webex::mcq() %>% cat()
  cat("</pre>")
    ```

  
3. Debug the following code.
    ```{r quiz-debug, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(iris) +
      geom_point(aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length, colour = Species)) +
      geom_smooth(method = lm) +
      facet_grid(Species)
    ```
    
    ```{r quiz-debug-answer, webex.hide = TRUE, fig.cap = ""}
    ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length, colour = Species)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = lm) +
      facet_grid(~Species)
    ```


4. Generate a plot like this from the built-in dataset `ChickWeight`.  

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = ""}
    ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(weight, Time)) +
      geom_hex(binwidth = c(10, 1)) +
      scale_fill_viridis_c()
    ```
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, webex.hide = TRUE}
    ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(weight, Time)) +
      geom_hex(binwidth = c(10, 1)) +
      scale_fill_viridis_c()
    ```

    
5. Generate a plot like this from the built-in dataset `iris`.

    ```{r quiz-cowplot, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.cap = ""}
    pw <- ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
      geom_density() +
      xlab("Petal Width (in cm)")
    
    pl <- ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
      geom_density() +
      xlab("Petal Length (in cm)") +
      coord_flip()
    
    pw_pl <- ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = lm) +
      xlab("Petal Width (in cm)") +
      ylab("Petal Length (in cm)")
    
    cowplot::plot_grid(
